    content: |-
      I am a Ph.D. candidate supervised by Prof. [Ying Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0089096) at Zhejiang University. 
      My reseasrch interests include marine robotics, underwater integrated navigation, and acoustic positioning systems.
      I have developed several underwater navigation/positioning systems and algorithms, which have been successfully applied in real-world underwater scenarios, and validated through extensive sea trials.
